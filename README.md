# RC Receiver Sampler using Arduino
This is an Arduino program for reading pulse width durations generated by an RC Receiver module. Tested with Arduino Uno and Nano models.

## Features
- Multiple channel support
- Pin change interrupts to detect rising and falling edges of PWM signals
- I2C communication for sending sampled pulse width values

## Dependencies
- [Yet Another Arduino PcInt Library](https://github.com/paulo-raca/YetAnotherArduinoPcIntLibrary) (Available on Arduino IDE library manager)
